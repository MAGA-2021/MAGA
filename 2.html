	<h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
		In order to serve our customers, we collect personally identifiable information, like names, addresses, email addresses, and sometimes credit card information when such information is voluntarily submitted by our visitors.

With your permission, we may also access other personal information on your device, such as your phone book, calendar or messages, in order to provide services to you. If authorized by you, we may also access profile and other information from services like Facebook.
		<br><br>
		We will NEVER share your information with third parties unless you have given us explicit permission to do so, such as in order to fulfill a third party offer that you have accepted from us. By permitting us to collect this information, you will be able to receive free information on products and services that may be of interest to you, including  related third party offers that we may send to you. You also enable us to personalize your experience with us so that we can provide you with the highest quality of service.

You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do.
		<br><br>
		In addition, you agree that by submitting your email address on this web site and/or registering to receive the product and/or service offered herein, such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry, and/or an application for the purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (ATSR), 16 CFR '310 et seq. and any applicable state and local "do not call" regulations. We retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR and the applicable state regulations.

	<h4>THIRD PARTY ACTIONS</h4>
		We do not control and are not liable for the actions of any third parties who we may promote. We pride ourselves in working with quality companies, but have no control over the actions of those third parties.

	<br>•	To facilitate our Service;
	<br>•	To provide the Service on our behalf;
	<br>•	To perform Service-related services; or
	<br>•	To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
	<br>We want to inform our Service users that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
		<br><br>
	<h4>COOKIES</h4>
		We may use cookies to deliver content that is specific to your interests. Cookies are text files that are used by your computer's web browser to store your preferences, and enable us to enhance your user experience with our web site.
		<br><br>
	<h4>IP ADDRESSES</h4>
		We may use your IP address to help prevent fraud, to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather broad demographic information, and to offer you products and services.
		<br><br>
	<h4>THIRD PARTY WEB SITES</h4>
		This web site and/or the products and/or services offered herein may direct you to web sites that are owned and/or controlled by third parties. We have no control over those third parties and are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of those sites or companies.
		<br><br>
	<h4>COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</h4>
		All information collected from you is stored in a technically and physically secure environment. We use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, and we do everything we can to protect user information offline. Unfortunately, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we take reasonable measures to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.
		<br><br>
	<h4>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY STATEMENT</h4>
		This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their rights under federal law with respect to such information.
		<br><br>
		This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. We screen users who wish to provide personal information in order to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site.
		<br><br>
		We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through the Site. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition the participation of a child under thirteen in the Site's online activities on providing personally identifiable information.
		<br><br>
